   <p>The Nagara style of temple architecture, prevalent in India from 200 BCE to 800 CE, is characterized by its distinct features that set it apart from other architectural styles. This style is most commonly associated with the northern and central regions of India. Here are the key characteristics and details of the Nagara style:</p>
   <h1 class="sub"><b>Key Features </b></h1>
   <p>
    <b>Shikhara (Tower):</b><br>
    <b>*</b> The most prominent feature of the Nagara style is the beehive-shaped tower known as the shikhara. <br>
    <b>*</b> The shikhara rises in a curvilinear fashion, symbolizing the sacred mountain or cosmic mountain. <br>
<b>Mandapa (Porch):</b><br>
<b>*</b>Nagara temples typically have a mandapa, or porch, which serves as an entrance <br>
<b>*</b>The mandapa is often supported by intricately carved pillars. <br>
<b>Garbhagriha (Sanctum Sanctorum):</b><br>
<b>*</b>The innermost chamber of the temple is the garbhagriha, housing the principal deity. <br>
<b>*</b>The garbhagriha is considered the most sacred part of the temple. <br>
<b>Vimana (Superstructure):</b><br>
<b>*</b>The superstructure of the temple, including the shikhara, is collectively referred to as the vimana. <br>
<b>*</b>The vimana symbolizes the abode of the deity and is intricately adorned with sculptures. <br>
<b>Amalaka and Kalasha:</b><br>
<b>*</b>The topmost part of the shikhara is often adorned with a circular stone disk called the amalaka. <br>
<b>*</b>A kalasha (pot-like structure) crowns the amalaka, representing cosmic energy. <br>
<b>Locational Variations:</b><br>
<b>*</b>The Nagara style exhibits regional variations. For example, the temples in Odisha and Rajasthan may have distinct characteristics within the overarching Nagara framework. <br>
<b>Sculptural Ornamentation:</b><br>
<b>*</b>Nagara temples are richly decorated with intricate sculptures and reliefs. <br>
<b>*</b>The sculptures often depict various deities, mythical creatures, and scenes from Hindu epics. <br>
<b>Panchayatana Layout:</b><br>
<b>*</b>Some Nagara temples follow the panchayatana layout, where subsidiary shrines are arranged around the main shrine. <br>
<b>*</b>This layout symbolizes the cosmic order and the interconnectedness of various deities. <br>
<b>Nandi Mandapa:</b><br>
<b>*</b>Many Nagara temples feature a separate structure dedicated to Nandi, the bull associated with Lord Shiva. <br>
<b>*</b>This Nandi mandapa is usually positioned in front of the main shrine. <br>
<b>Evolution Over Time:</b><br>
<b>*</b>The Nagara style evolved over the centuries, with later temples becoming more elaborate and larger in scale. <br>
<b>*</b>Prominent examples include the temples at Khajuraho, Mount Abu, and Bhojpur. <br><br>
The Nagara style, with its iconic shikhara and elaborate sculptural details, remains an integral part of Indiaâ€™s architectural heritage. Its influence can be seen in the temple structures across northern and central India, contributing to the diverse tapestry of Indian temple architecture.
